# BigDataProject-Netflix
Student project using PyMongo and Spark for a Big Data module

For this project we wanted to know if Netflix and Amazon prime tackled society issues thanks to their content. 
We used two data sets available on Kaggle : 
Netflix : https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
Amazon : https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows

We used PyMongo and PySpark to do some requests and then compile the results into a PDF report also available.
